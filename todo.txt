x Fix the bug of textbox not having the background when playing through
  from chapter 1 to 2.
- Fix textboxes not retaining their scale or something? talking to
  Eleanor doesn't retain the same stuff.
- Chapter 2: Dinner Party
  x Camera with level with multiple screens
  x Bouncer
  x Jake and Erica
  x Mike and Jessica
  x People at the start chilling, they have dates.
  x Dinner party tables
  - Dialogue with Amy -> Penny
  - Penelope comes (shift the camera to the side like undertale)
  - Fullscreen image of you, then her looking at you (your eyes catch)
  - You go up to her then teleport to...
  - bathroom
  - Closeup of a window with wind blowing, with the
  - Ending text over it.

- We need to have a really short 30 second intro
  (3d) which shows the overarching God themes as well
  as the theme of meaninglessness.

Later
- Intro: Make it the same setting as the epilogue-- the jail.
         Introduce the feeling of meaninglessness and depression
         that Chase has.
- At the end of chapter 1, make it so that the player is kept
  at the middle of the screen so it looks like he's getting out
  of bed when the switch occurs.
- Add a white overlay that slowly increases in alpha over time for
  suspense.
- In the final build, we should use a VHS effect.
- Change the render target that footsteps and blood are rendered
  to so that the player isn't rendered below them.

------

The only implementation related thing that might need some elbow
grease is a VHS shader, but that's something that we know can
be made, and should be one of the last things that I even do
on the game.

Add some sort of intensity uniform that can affect how bad the
VHS quality drops. Also, I like when it has the artifact of
the image stretching really bad at the bottom and top.

------

I'll finish up the general design today.
When doing each individual chapter, I will design the dialogue
within that time, I won't do everything in advance.

------

We should work hard; 2-3 days per segment.
