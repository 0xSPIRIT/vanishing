TODO : Today

- Next model scene (load)
- Dinner party (II)
  x Exit the train onto the new scene
  x Model the new scene; beginner's guide
    esque. The point is it's supposed to be
    contrasted with the previous part.
    Spiral staircase with blue sky,
    concrete and modern styles. Spend some
    time on it to get it right. After the
  x staircase at the top is a door. When
    you open it, you're back in the dinner
    party.
  - Dinner party scene. Dark. All the heads
    are looking at you. Model it the same as
    the 2D version.
  - They have the same dialogue
    from before, but then at the end Chase says,
    "Wait, say that again?".
  - The screen flashes, and the dialogue is replaced
    with much more friendly and warm conversation-
    it's just Chase's mind having a negatively
    skewed perception. Their heads are also replaced
    with regular heads.
  - Thinking: are we going to ignore penny? She should
    appear, shouldn't she? Or maybe he's still blocked
    here.
  - Exit door
- Next model scene (load): beginner's guide esque modern house
- Penny dialogue text
- Walk through another door, teleport to apartment (atari)
- Phone call: "I'm you from the future!"

A phone call with a future version of yourself:
  The universe does not stop behaving chaotically just because you
  don't want it to. We must all come to terms with our situations.
  It sounds like a fancier way of saying, "shit happens", but it
  IS our situation, and we MUST find meaning in our predicaments.
  When bad things happen to you, that is not God disgracing you,
  or punishing you-- that is being human.

- We need to have a really short 30 second intro
  (3d) which shows the overarching God themes as well
  as the theme of meaninglessness.

- Chapter 1: follow the footsteps in the ending rather than
             following the water so that it lines you up
             better to be looking like you're getting
             otu of bed. Also change the text at the end

- Add an interactible object in chapter 1 to "pray to god".

Later
- In chapter 5, add parts in each of the three parts where you have to look
  at an object at a certain perspective to go progress, taking advantage of
  the 3D.
- Chapter 4:
  Really distorted, pitched-down text to speech voice for chase
  rather than text scroll sound.
- Somehow include a window in the first chapter somewhere?
- chapter 2: add white thing right before teleporting to bathroom with penny
- Replace the font renderer with your own for the document
  review section so we can use monospaced fonts properly.
- Make sure that nothing overlaps in the first chapter
  when you move screens. Especially make sure that it
  can't spawn inside the player.
- Make sure all the God text is Black at first, not red.
- For the devil text in one of the final chapters you can
  use the Document Review instead of regular textboxes.
- Intro: Make it the same setting as the epilogue-- the jail.
         Introduce the feeling of meaninglessness and depression
         that Chase has.
         Introduce the mysterious monster which hooks people
         and also introduces the themes that will be covered.

- At the end of chapter 1, make it so that the player is kept
  at the middle of the screen so it looks like he's getting out
  of bed when the switch occurs.
- Add a white overlay that slowly increases in alpha over time for
  suspense.
- In the final build, we should use a VHS effect.
- Change the render target that footsteps and blood are rendered
  to so that the player isn't rendered below them.

------

The only implementation related thing that might need some elbow
grease is a VHS shader, but that's something that we know can
be made, and should be one of the last things that I even do
on the game.

Add some sort of intensity uniform that can affect how bad the
VHS quality drops. Also, I like when it has the artifact of
the image stretching really bad at the bottom and top.

We should work hard; 2-3 days per segment.
