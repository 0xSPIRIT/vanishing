- Somehow include a window in the first chapter somewhere?

A phone call with a future version of yourself:
  The universe does not stop behaving chaotically just because you
  don't want it to. We must all come to terms with our situations.
  It sounds like a fancier way of saying, "shit happens", but it
  IS the situation, and we must find meaning in our predicaments.
  When bad things happen to you, that is not God disgracing you,
  or punishing you-- that is being human.

- We need to have a really short 30 second intro
  (3d) which shows the overarching God themes as well
  as the theme of meaninglessness.

Later
- Intro: Make it the same setting as the epilogue-- the jail.
         Introduce the feeling of meaninglessness and depression
         that Chase has.
- At the end of chapter 1, make it so that the player is kept
  at the middle of the screen so it looks like he's getting out
  of bed when the switch occurs.
- Add a white overlay that slowly increases in alpha over time for
  suspense.
- In the final build, we should use a VHS effect.
- Change the render target that footsteps and blood are rendered
  to so that the player isn't rendered below them.

------

The only implementation related thing that might need some elbow
grease is a VHS shader, but that's something that we know can
be made, and should be one of the last things that I even do
on the game.

Add some sort of intensity uniform that can affect how bad the
VHS quality drops. Also, I like when it has the artifact of
the image stretching really bad at the bottom and top.

------

I'll finish up the general design today.
When doing each individual chapter, I will design the dialogue
within that time, I won't do everything in advance.

------

We should work hard; 2-3 days per segment.
