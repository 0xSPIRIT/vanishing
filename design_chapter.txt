1. Dysania

He opened his eyes.
He was thirsty, his tongue drier than the sand he stood atop.
God had placed him here for a reason.
But aside from that, he was looking for something.
But what, exactly, eluded him.

After 2 screens, you see your first node.
"This one calls itself 83D3960AA4B1 (READ ERROR).
 Activate it? (Yes/No)"

The nodes represents things that can have meaning.

If you select no, you can't move to other screens.
It shocks you, and you start bleeding. It fizzles out.

After another screen, you find another node.
"This one calls itself DD1CEA177C0 (READ ERROR).
 Activate it? (Yes/No)"

You start walking slower.

You see a phone booth thing, you ring for help.

C: Hello?
O: Yes.
C: Um, do you know how I get out of here?
   I'm... so thirsty...
O: Oh, you're stuck there?
   Most people find their way out pretty easily.
C: ...
   I keep walking but it goes on forever.
O: It's simple. You just go up, then down, then up, then
   left, and you'll find what you're looking for.
C: Are you sure? Those directions don't make any sense.
O: Trust me, you'll find it there.
C: Okay.

- You do that, then you get another node.
You drop to the ground, and are crawling now.

The next screen you go to, you see a forest with trees and
flowing water. You go towards it.

"I must... get..."
"Please... G-God..."
"Reveal yourself... to me..."

Chase sat at a cafe on a bright Saturday morning.
He listened to the hustle and bustle of the commuters;
saw their happy faces ordering their breakfast.
Laughter erupted at a nearby table-- a group of friends.

...
... "Bastards."

He was envious.
He tried looking outside;

Laid his eyes on an infinite void,
trying to feel something-- anything!

... But couldn't.

He went to sleep that night particularly perturbed.

3. Repetitions

Overall Design:

- Working in a cubicle, an office job.
- Minigame of doing some random stuff- it doesn't satisfy him.
- His coworkers talk about random stuff that doesn't matter.
- You mention to them that you have a recurring dream of being
  trapped in a prison with no way out, and they seem weirdly dismissive
  of what you said, and they just sort of ignore you.
- You pretend to care about what's happening.
- The people from his job start disappearing, the others forgetting
  they even existed.
  [These people are meaningless to Chase.]
- Chase is frightened because he is afraid he will vanish too,
  because his life is meaningless.
- He stares at an open window.
- Cut to driving home. (Mareux - Underground or SPIT IN MY FACE
                        throughout the rest of the scene)
  First-person perspective but still Atari
- You enter your home, and scroll on your phone, trying to numb your
  mind.

Specific Design:

  x Infinite cubicles: sense of meaninglessness.
  x You have to find which one is your number (1138)
  x You sit down at the cubicle (popup text)
  x Repeating intermediary rooms with diminishing colors
    until you have to walk through a room in darkness.
  x Job minigame:
    x You work as a document reviewer.
      You go through documents that need to be sent
      out. You find inconsistencies and spelling
      errors in them and you correct them by clicking
      on them. When you found all the errors, you click
      finish.
  - Snap cut to eating lunch with your coworkers.
  - They're talking about random bullshit that you're pretending to
    care about.
  - You snap cut back to the minigame again, and do a few more
    requests.
  - Then you snap cut to lunch. They're talking more BS.
  - You snap cut back to the minigame again, and do a few more
    requests.
  - Snap cut to lunch. You stop one of them this time, the music
    cuts, and you talk about a recurring dream that you've had.
    You're in a prison with no way out, and you get a call from
    someone. You know that in the dream you're surprised that
    you get the call, but somehow also infuriated afterwards.
    After you wake up, you always forget who was calling.
  - You say, "anyways, where's XYZ person?", you haven't seen him.
    No one knows what you're talking about...
  - Chase is frightened.
  - Stares at open window, increase tension
  - Cut to driving home (Mareux - Underground esque music)
    (first person but atari, 2 frame loop)
  - Cut to home. Collapse on bed.
  - Scroll on your phone for like 30 seconds until
    you pass out.
