TODO 

- Create proper artwork for the apartment
  - And fix up the pixel locations for chapter 1, and 4.
- Create the driving segment in chapter 3
- You live in an apartment not a house
- Create the rest of the apartment in chapter 3, you walk
  through it. (put keys down)
- In chapter 4 add a part beforehand where you're microwaving
  food or something.
- Put collision geometry in the paintings and the tree in chapter 5.

Future TODO

- Add dialogue to the characters in dinner party after
  you talk to eleanor and you're walking up to penny.
- Don't lerp the djinns, make them step forward in increments
- I mean, the textboxes shouldn't make the text itself transparent
  along with textbox_alpha. Just make the text render to a separate
  texture at 255 alpha.

I did a run through of the game. One thing that it's
missing is coherency. I need to add more glue to
bind everything together.

- Add more choice dialogue elements about your own
  psychology. Add branching elements as well.

- Fix up the windows to actually have a cool effect
  when you look through them: you don't see reality.
  You see things that are not there, like monsters, etc.
  Draw another scene using the same camera position and
  somehow draw it in the same spot?

- "I'm sick of chasing" - double entendre

- In the white parts, use intro font: Ex pluribus unum veritas

- You can get stuck in the paintings

Later
- Chapter 4:
  Really distorted, pitched-down text to speech voice for chase
  rather than text scroll sound.
- chapter 2: add white vhs thing right before teleporting to bathroom with hope
- Add a white vhs overlay that slowly increases in intensity over time
  for suspense.

The only implementation related thing that might need some elbow
grease is a VHS shader, but that's something that we know can
be made, and should be one of the last things that I even do
on the game.

Add some sort of intensity uniform that can affect how bad the
VHS quality drops. Also, I like when it has the artifact of
the image stretching really bad at the bottom and top.

We should work hard; 2-3 days per segment.
