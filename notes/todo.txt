TODO 

- Fix up chapter 2 sprites. Make it inspired, and not just making things
  because it needs to have something there.
- Add transition between train station and staircase.

TODO (Future)

- Get Tarrandat to make the road sprites.

Movie scenes
x The emptiness scene basically gives the idea of the young
  girl being punished for no reason, and that no God is
  around to save her from this meaningless death. (Allegory
  to Chase's position).
  (Chapter 6)
x The window scene is perfect the way it is.
  (Chapter 4, when you go to bed)
