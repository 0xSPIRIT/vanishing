TODO 

x Chapter 4: make the beginning part a bit more structured.
  x Some nights it's darker....It's just the wind
x Window fullscreen sprite
- Chapter 3 road sprites
- Create proper artwork for the dinner party
- Add 2 more movies
  - One right after the dialogue in chapter 6 and before
    desert. (Make sure you cut to black immediately instead
    of waiting for the player to press enter on the final
    dialogue text)

Movie scenes
x The emptiness scene basically gives the idea of the young
  girl being punished for no reason, and that no God is
  around to save her from this meaningless death. (Allegory
  to Chase's position).
  (Chapter 6)
- The hand scene basically gives you the idea of being
  ok with your situation, and finding meaning in it.
  "I, Antonious Block, am playing Chess with Death!"
  (Epilogue, right before talk with penny)
- The window scene is perfect the way it is.
  (Chapter 4, when you go to bed)
