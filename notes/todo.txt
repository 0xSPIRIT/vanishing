Later
- Chapter 4:
  Really distorted, pitched-down text to speech voice for chase
  rather than text scroll sound.
- chapter 2: add white vhs thing right before teleporting to bathroom with hope
- Add a white vhs overlay that slowly increases in intensity over time
  for suspense.

The only implementation related thing that might need some elbow
grease is a VHS shader, but that's something that we know can
be made, and should be one of the last things that I even do
on the game.

Add some sort of intensity uniform that can affect how bad the
VHS quality drops. Also, I like when it has the artifact of
the image stretching really bad at the bottom and top.

We should work hard; 2-3 days per segment.
