- Music for chapter 6: something other than just the same noise
  that we've been hearing for the whole game. Use a different
  noise & add some strings or piano something. Modulate the pitch
  of the music based on the speed of the player, so when the
  player stops, the music stops.
- Music for Epilogue
  - Something reflective, piano, strings that slowly come in.
    The piece should feel like slowly realizing something
    that will make a big difference in your life, yet unsure
    at the same time.
- Music for Penny
  - Piano solo, something impressionistic with a mistake in
    the middle; he hit the wrong note, play a "sigh" sound,
    and then continue.
- Sometimes Movie doesn't start at chapter 5 after playing through
  the game. Crashes.
- Handwrite chapter intros
- Redo road sprites in chapter 3

  CloseAudioDevice() and InitAudioDevice() works well.
