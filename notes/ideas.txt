Vanishing
---------

A short horror game based in Atari-style graphics as well as 3D graphics,
switching between the two at times. It is about the elusive nature of true
fulfilment, and the search for meaning.

The game is separated into Chapters, going through certain moments in Chase's
life.

TODO:
  - We should focus on design for today, and maybe some light code
    structuring or testing for something.
  - Design
    - Block out the entire game.
    - Have some funny/happy moments to compliment the disturbing ones.
    - Figure out how to communicate Chase's feelings of meaninglessness.
  - Do some test atari closeups to see if you can do it;
    - Closeup of Chase looking to the right.
    - Closeup of Chase looking towards the window (the camera is at the window)
    - Closeup of him smiling in the same pose

Chase: Protagonist
  - All human sprites are the same to show that everyone probably has something
    going on as well in their personal lives. Different colors are used to
    differentiate between male and female.

  - Personality:
      Introverted,
      but can fake extroversion and seems to have a good time,
      likes to laugh and make jokes,
      but his brain is his worst enemy;
      retroactively making things worse even when it doesn't,
      not being able to hold conversations sometimes,
      and being depressed resulting in a feeling of meaninglessness and malaise.

  - He sometimes has no interest or excitement in anything in his life, except maybe playing music

  - He seems to have a fun time with friends, but afterwards, his brain tries to
    make things meaningless in retrospect. On the drive home, for instance.

  - He goes on a search for God, to find meaning in his meaningless existence
  - He speaks into the void many times, with no response. He desperately wants divine purpose
  - People from his office job start disappearing, and people act like they never existed.
  - Dinner Party; he wants to talk to a girl he likes but doesn't (doesn't take agency)
  - She ends up disappearing too.
  - At Home; he scrolls feeds on his phone, consuming content like a glutton,
    trying to dull the pain
  - Cut back to Atari, and he smiles (2-frames, one with an expression of dread, and another
    with overwhelming happiness)
  - He leaves his house, and ends up at a train station, in the black of night.
  - "Don't look behind you. I am here but you shall not see me. If you do, you will die."
    You look behind you, you see nothing, then when you look forward again, it's replaced with
    WHITENESS. Then, you look behind you again and you're completely in a white void.
  - You follow small black orbs, and a light path on the floor. When you go up
    to them, a textbox popups up and says "This one is named money", "This one is
    named (the girl from the dinner party)", "This one is named food", "This one
    is named alcohol", "This one is named sex", "This one is named drugs", "This
    one is named a fulfilling job" :: the hedonistic treadmill.
  - At each black orb, there is an door with a green exit sign. "Are you
    sure?" The door closes with a noise and that's the end. You can go on
    catching the black
    orbs forever if you want, they keep generating names after a while.

Analysis

The vanishing of certain characters represents Chase's detachment and
disconnection from reality and other people-- his problem of
meaninglessness manifest physically. It also shows his spiritual
desolation.
