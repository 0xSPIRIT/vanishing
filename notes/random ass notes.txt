What do I get from the game?

(x) represents things that have a resolution
Basic shape that I want the game to have:
  - meaningless desert (x)
  - capsules represent meaningful activities (x)
  - chase isn't fulfilled by anything (x)
  - penny is love interest, composer (x)
  - he wants god to give him meaning (x)
  - dinner party, everyone's super weird
  - eleanor good funny
  - boring job, more meaninglessness
  - peggy and hunter is allegorical. he wants that to happen to him
  - he changes the meaning in the emails
  - he doesn't understand his coworkers and are jealous of their feelings
    of meaningfulness.
  - they must have made a deal with the devil himself (x)
  - scroll on phone to numb the pain
  - you meet god (devil) and tells you to do a bunch of shady shit
  - you don't want to do it and go on a spiritual journey (train station) (x)
  - your world and what you hear people say is based off your perception.
  - in the staircase you see your negative thoughts on the podiums
  - your brain shows you negative scenarios like the dinner party.
  - your brain shows you the actual version of what happens (white)
  - Desert again, the feelings came back like they always do.
  - you find new perspectives in the art gallery even though you didn't
    think you would learn anything new
  - but you're still unenlightened, and you still don't understand anything.
  - phone call from future-you!
  - you're reaching for a node again, representing wanting to do something,
    but it's replaced by a sprite of you.
  - you take the advice from teh future you, and have patience with your
    next encoutner with devil.
  - in the end you take a single opportunity to talk with penny.

Chapter 1:
  Intro Text:
    Dread Filled him, stranded in desert - meaninglessness, hopelessness.
    no stars in sight - lack of god, lack of hope.
  Thirsty - Wants meaning, existence is suffering.
  Capsule - The liquid inside hurts you, but its supposed to be quenching.
          - The code on the bottom cannot be read because he's not in the
            right mindset. You'll see what they mean in the epilogue.
          - The capsules represent opportunities or actions that you
            do and somehow get meaning. This is foreign to him.
  Phone Call - Phone call with a future version of yourself as you
               will find out later.
    Most people get out easily - It's so easy for other people to
    overcome the meaninglessness but you're fucked.
    "It's so simple, silly!" - It's so simple for others; even yourself
    in the future when you eventually overcome it.
    "you have to go up, down, up, left" - Really arbitrary and random
   God Text-
     "The great veil stands firm" - This has multiple meanings.
       1) The social veil between Chase and others. He is introverted,
          doesn't get along with others as much as he would like.
       2) The veil of God itself. you can't see him because he cannot
          be seen.
       3) The entity chase is talking about here is also penny.

Chapter 2:
  - Dinner party is a big shift
  - Talking to eleanor, she's the only person you don't think is judging you.

Chapter 3:
  - Repetitive, meaningless, etc
  - Peggy and Hunter <=> Penny and Chase
  -
