Chapter 2 Dialogue
------------------

1.
  Eavesdrop?
    Woman: Indubitably. I mean, the optics of synergy could never
           outpace the undercurrents of the underlying dissonance
           in the market.
    Man:   Mhm, and when you really think about it, isn't every
           paradigm shift just a prelude to the inevitable alteration
           of norms?
    Woman: Exactly! The scaffolding of progress is always contingent
           on the elasticity of collective buy-in.
    Man:   Y'know, it kinda makes you wonder, does innovation truly
           disrupt, or does it juts accelerate the preordained
           trajectory?
    Woman: Wonderfully said, Josh. But then, aren't these frequencies
           that underlie the ethos of our existence simply constructs,
           based on an arbitrary spectrum we've agreed upon?
    Man:   Possibly. But agreeing is in itself is an act of placing
           your foot into the door of futile chaos we call constructs.

  Eavesdrop?
    Man:     Oh. My. God.
    Woman 1: What?
    Man:     Look at what JJ posted...
             Check IG.
    Woman 2: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    Woman 1: Nooooo WHATT?!?!
             After all that "starting
             the new year with a free
             soul" BS!?
    Woman 3: Hahaaaaaaa, and don't forget
             all the "shedding my past"
             shit she posted to her story.
    Man:     Bro, I don't understand
             these people.
    Woman 1: When Cece sees that she's
             gonna be PISSED.
    Woman 2: Yup. We all know how she
             is with him talking to
             other people.
    Man:     This is gonna be crazy.
             We need more drinks.

  The girl sips her drink nonchalantly.
  She gives you a scornful glare
  before returning to her phone.

    Woman: Good.
