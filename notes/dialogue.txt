Chapter 2 Dialogue

Eavesdrop?
  Woman: Indubitably. I mean, the optics of synergy could never
         outpace the undercurrents of the underlying dissonance
         in the market.
  Man:   Mhm, and when you really think about it, isn't every
         paradigm shift just a prelude to the inevitable alteration
         of norms?
  Woman: Exactly! The scaffolding of progress is always contingent
         on the elasticity of collective buy-in.
  Man:   Y'know, it kinda makes you wonder, does innovation truly
         disrupt, or does it juts accelerate the preordained
         trajectory?
  Woman: Wonderfully said, Josh. But then, aren't these frequencies
         that underlie the ethos of our existence simply constructs,
         based on an arbitrary spectrum we've agreed upon?
  Man:   Possibly. But agreeing is in itself is an act of placing
         your foot into the door of futile chaos we call constructs.
