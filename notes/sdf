Note: we can slip this in right after the "Congratulations you
      have wasted your time" text, and right before you talk
      with Penny - so that's still the final thing in the game.

Chase:   Hello? Is this you again?
Unknown: Yes?
Chase:   May I ask you a question?
Unknown: What makes you think my word will mean something?
Chase:   I don't know.
Unknown: ... Fair enough.
Unknown: What's the question?
Chase:   I have seen to the edges of the divine.
         From the desert, to the dinner, to the
         cubicles, to the nights of terror.
         I've seen the endless staircase,
         the path to Nirvana.
         I've seen the Monoliths tower over,
         immovable and infinite.
         I've seen every golden hour yield to
         the darkest nights...

         Please, why must we suffer so?

...

The universe does not answer "why" questions.
"Why" is a human construction, Chase.

But, you know that you suffer.
And it is painful.
But that is okay.

The void says nothing because, of course,
there is nothing there.

The universe does not help you when you are broken,
You must seek that out yourself.

Nor does she congratulate you when you overcome,
You must seek that out yourself.

She is neutral.

The universe does not care about you,
so you have to care about yourself.

Nonetheless, you must find meaning in this
hodgepodge of circumstance.
Meaning created by your hand, crafted
with the utmost care, in accordance
with Her hand.

I say, feel the pain!
There is no alternative!
Crushing truths perish from being acknowledged!

And eventually, probably soon, you will be filled
with the indescribable feeling of belonging.
