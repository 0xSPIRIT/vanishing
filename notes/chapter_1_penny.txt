We need to setup Penny a bit more:
  - chase thinks she's perfect
  - wants to act but doesn't because of his anxiety
  - met through a friend
  - she has similar interests
  - penny is important to the story because she's
    the anchor by which chase gets out of this
    state at the end; he takes the opportunity at
    the end of the game.
  - to sum up the game's story he just needed a bad bitch
    in his life to fix him

Chase:   Uh hello?
Eleanor: Heyyy Chase
         I got someone for you
Chase:   Uhhh, what?
Eleanor: Y'know, SOMEONE!!
Chase:   Does this really require a phone call?
         You could've sent me a message that I
         would have pretended not to read.
Eleanor: Ugh FINE, bye byeee
Chase:   Waaait hold on,
         I've been trying to get up
         for the past 45 minutes,
         I'm just cranky.
         We're already here.
         Who do you got?
Eleanor: Penny.
Chase:   Penelope?
         Baron's Penny?
Eleanor: Come on, she's perfect
         She even composes just like you!!!!
Chase:   What type of music?
Eleanor: Talk to her yourself and find out.
Chase:   Can I state the obvious here sis?
         It's BARON's Penny.
Eleanor: Uh, the same Baron that swears at her
         and treats her like shit?
         That doesn't matter, trust me.
Chase:   ...
Eleanor: Sooo what do you think bro?
Chase:   ...

         I'll think about it.
Eleanor: *sigh* We all know what that mea-
