1. Dysania

He opened his eyes.
He was thirsty, his tongue drier than the sand he stood atop.
God had placed him here for a reason.
But aside from that, he was looking for something.
But what, exactly, eluded him.

After 2 screens, you see your first node.
"This one calls itself 83D3960AA4B1 (READ ERROR).
 Activate it? (Yes/No)"

The nodes represents things that can have meaning.

If you select no, you can't move to other screens.
It shocks you, and you start bleeding. It fizzles out.

After another screen, you find another node.
"This one calls itself DD1CEA177C0 (READ ERROR).
 Activate it? (Yes/No)"

You start walking slower.

You see a phone booth thing, you ring for help.

C: Hello?
O: Yes.
C: Um, do you know how I get out of here?
   I'm... so thirsty...
O: Oh, you're stuck there?
   Most people find their way out pretty easily.
C: ...
   I keep walking but it goes on forever.
O: It's simple. You just go up, then down, then up, then
   left, and you'll find what you're looking for.
C: Are you sure? Those directions don't make any sense.
O: Trust me, you'll find it there.
C: Okay.

- You do that, then you get another node.
You drop to the ground, and are crawling now.

The next screen you go to, you see a forest with trees and
flowing water. You go towards it.

"I must... get..."
"Please... G-God..."
"Reveal yourself... to me..."

Chase sat at a cafe on a bright Saturday morning.
He listened to the hustle and bustle of the commuters;
saw their happy faces ordering their breakfast.
Laughter erupted at a nearby table-- a group of friends.

...
... "Bastards."

He was envious.
He tried looking outside;

Laid his eyes on an infinite void,
trying to feel something-- anything!

... But couldn't.

He went to sleep that night particularly perturbed.
