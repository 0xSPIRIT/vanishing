[Showing the struggle of getting out of bed]
Text Appears: "Dysania"

(Atari Graphics)
- You're walking through the desert, thirsty and about to die.
- You try to reach out to someone.
- You scream out for help to God.
- You teleport to your house, you're exiting your bedroom.
- Show you taking deep breaths. (Possible showing rotoscope animation
  of me walking out door looking sad and apathetic)
(Ensure you retain the sense of direness here.)

[Showing not taking agency in life]
Text Appears: "Dinner Party"

(Atari Graphics)
- You enter the room, it seems like some sort of event.
- You talk to the person at the front before you enter, and they're
  really judgy for some reason, and you don't push back on anything
  they say. This person's design has a huge triangle head and a single
  huge eye.
- You sit at a dinner table with your friends.
- You're joking with your friends, but it's just a mask, a show. You
  don't really care about what's going on, and you aren't adding much
  to the conversation.
- You notice a girl (pink) sit at another table- Penelope (Penny)
- You're in shock, you didn't think you'd see her there.
- Both your eyes catch for a second.
(3D Graphics)
- Your friends say you should talk to her, but when you start walking
  to her...
- Teleport to the bathroom.
- Closeup of an open window.
- Text Appears: "I pray for courage but find only echoes."
                "I pray for purpose but find only echoes."
                "I must be cured. I must be saved."
                "When will you reveal yourself to me?"

[Showing meaninglessness in life]
Text Appears: "Repetitions"

- Working in a cubicle, an office job.
- Minigame of doing some random stuff- it doesn't satisfy him.
- His coworkers talk about random stuff that doesn't matter.
- You mention to them that you have a recurring dream of being
  trapped in a prison with no way out, and they seem weirdly dismissive
  of what you said, and they just sort of ignore you.
- You pretend to care about what's happening.
- The people from his job start disappearing, the others forgetting
  they even existed.
  [These people are meaningless to Chase.]
- Chase is frightened.
- He stares at an open window.
- Cut to driving home. (Mareux - Underground or SPIT IN MY FACE
                        throughout the rest of the scene)
  First-person perspective but still Atari
- You enter your home, and scroll on your phone, trying to numb your
  mind.

[Yearning for purpose]
Text Appears: "Theophany"

- You ensure the windows are closed and you fall asleep.

- At night, sleeping, his eyebrows wince, then hears something
  whispering to him. His eyes open with dread and looks to his left.
- (3D Graphics) There's the window that is open that wasn't when he
  went to bed.
- The camera zooms into it.
- Chase asks, "Is that you?", "Have you come for me?"

- Black text appears: "I HEAR THEE, MY SON."
- Chase goes from intensely scared to a huge smile.
- Black text appears: "WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?"
- Chase: "Meaning and fulfillment."
- Black text appears: "GOOD.
                       TO GRANT YOUR PRAYER, YOU MUST COMPLETE A TASK
                       FOR ME.
-                      SHOW THAT YOUR FAITH IS PURE."
- Chase: "I will do anything you ask, Lord."
- Black text appears:

            DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

- Chase: "I- well... I don't know how that will..."

            DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

- Chase: "... Yes."

[Showing how perception changes when you're depressed]
Text Appears: "Perception"

Text Appears:
  I don't have the courage to do what the Lord has asked.
  It's been weeks.
  I think I know who I should visit.

(3D graphics)
- He leaves his house, and ends up at a train station, in the black of
  night. There's an open window somewhere which represents God is watching.
- You buy a ticket from a person that has a pyramid head who's especially
  judgy for no reason. Their head has one huge eye on it.
- You question why they're acting so odd. They say they're not.
- Their head rotates now and their face is now more normal.
  Their dialogue is normal now, not displaying any exaggerated negative
  speech.

- You enter the train, and exit immediately on another exit.

- You're in a modern-style minimalist house similar to houses in
  The Beginner's Guide.

  J is a triangle-headed person.

  J: "Have you found what you're looking for?"
     "Purpose?"
  C: "I'm not sure, I don't think I've found it yet."
  J: "Me too. What, do you think you're the only one who hasn't?"
  C: "Nothing I accomplish is fulfilling for me. Are you telling me
      that happens to everyone?"
  J: "No, of course not. Some people have it easier than others, but
      that is how it is."
  C: "Seriously? "It is what it is?" You have to be kidding."
  J: "You're trying too hard to find a solution, Chase.
      Have you always been like this?"
  C: "Pretty much most of my life."
  J: "But not always?"
  C: "Ah, great. So we're "focusing on the positives."
      I understand now that you don't understand.
      Goodbye."

You walk through another door, and you're back in your room again...

(Atari Graphics)
You have a phone call.

  F: "I'm you from the future!"
  C: "Did you escape the prison?"
  F: "Yes! I did, would you like to know how I did it?"
  C: "Yes."
  F: "Oh, so all you have to do is have patience, and-"
  C: "Are you still there..?"
  F: "I'm sorry, I just realized I didn't escape after all.
      It turns out I'm still in the prison, there was just
      a bigger one around the previous one.
      I'll call you back if I do escape, promise."
  C: "Wait wh-"

Text Appears: "Patience and Blasphemy"

(Atari Graphics)
- You're walking through the desert again, thirsty and about to die.
- You try to reach out to a node...

- Cross Fade into the bedroom.
- Black Text: "YOU DIDN'T COMPLETE THE TASK THAT I ASKED."
- You:        "I changed my mind."
- Black Text: "No, no, no. You must complete this, otherwise you
               won't get what you want. What you NEED.
               MEANING. PURPOSE. CONTENTMENT. I AM THE ALL-POWERFUL,
               I CAN GRANT YOU WHATEVER AND WHOMEVER YOU PLEASE.

The screen goes RED, with a deafening noise amping up the tension.
Then BLACKNESS.

Text Appears: "Epilogue"

(3D Graphics)
You're in a white void.
You are enclosed in bars that surround you.
There are orbs on the ground which look like the same nodes with
liquid in it from the first chapter. When you go up to touch
them, a message appears:

    "This one is named hanging out with friends"
    "This one is named eating good food."
    "This one is named learning guitar."
    "This one is named taking an afternoon drive."
    "This one is named sports."

  At each point, you decide not to pick them up because
  you are trying to find a way out of the jail bars. You
  can't focus, and feel sad. You need to get a little break,
  don't you?

  You go to the door and be patient until it opens, on a timer.
  It opens slowly over time.

  You get to the other side.

  You make a phone call.

  Wow, I got out! I need to make a phone call.

  F: "I'm you from the future!"
  C: "Did you escape the prison?"
  F: "Yes! I did, would you like to know how I did it?"
  C: "Yes."
  F: "Oh, so all you have to do is have patience, and-"
  C: "Are you still there..?"
  F: "I'm sorry, I just realized I didn't escape after all.
      It turns out I'm still in the prison, there was just
      a bigger one around the previous one.
      I'll call you back if I do escape, promise."
  C: "Wait wh-"
  *click*

  When you get to the other side, the same thing happens, but
  with different opportunities.
    "This one is named learning a new skill"
    "This one is named taking an internship."
    "This one is named talking to someone important."
    "This one is named finding love."

  Even though you get the option yes or no, you continue to ignore them.
  You find that these things are meaningless, even though you'd like
  to have them in theory. You move on through this jail, and onto the
  next segment.

  There aren't any orbs. You just wait for the jail to open.

  In the next segment, there's one orb. "Pick it up?"
  If you answer yes, he says: "Why not?"

(Atari graphics)
Having a smoke with the girl from the start.
You talk to her about something that interests you both.

Analysis

Putting this stuff here so I can remember... I forget these
things easily.

- The Devil/God is represented by an open window because suicide is
  the best thing he can get Chase to do.
- The whole thing is about meaninglessness and a search for
  fulfillment.
- The devil disguised as God (or is God himself) represents Chase's
  inner desire to stop, hold back, and continue living a nothing
  life, eventually killing him via suicide.
- Chase feels a sense of malaise in everything he does because he
  keeps focusing on "escaping for good". There is no such thing.
- The bad times must exist, and he must ride them out, and he must
  cherish the good times. It's not a reason not to take opportunities;
  otherwise you'll be 50 without kids and an unfulfilling job and you
  will have realized you wasted your life.
- When you're in this state your brain makes wrong perceptive
  judgements on others, skewing them negative.
- The game also talks about pepole trying to give advice to Chase,
  "It is what it is", "You're not the only one", "Focus on the
  positives" -- this can be good advice but in certain contexts.
- The infinite subset of prisons references the cyclical nature of
  the human condition, and it tells you that you should enjoy the
  times you have. You're still trapped, sure, but enjoy what you
  have.
- Chase is too obsessed with getting out of the jail ("fixing" his
  problem) that he has no time to actually live. Everything loses
  meaning. He may still do some activities like going out with
  friends but he doesn't cherish it and experience it in the moment.
- The advice from Chase that came from himself "Be patient" is what
  actually ended up helping him. It came from himself, not anyone
  else.

- Chase is thirsty for meaning and purpose
- The guy on the phone says that there's "water" everywhere!
  People don't really get stuck in the desert for very long,
  if at all.
- Chase sees the "water", sure, but it's not water to him.
  It's painful.
- It's shown as something easy to get to, but the instructions
  seem arbitrary. "Go up, down, up, left!"
