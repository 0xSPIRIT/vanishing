[Showing how perception changes when you're depressed]
Text Appears: "Perception"

- He leaves his house, and ends up at a train station, in the black of night.
- You buy a ticket from a person that has a pyramid head who's especially judgy
  for no reason. Their head has one huge eye on it.
- You question why they're acting so odd. They say they're not.
- They immediately transform into a (more) regular model, and their dialogue is
  normal now.

- You enter the train, and exit immediately on another exit.

- You're at the dinner party again, with only the two dinner tables; your table
  and the table with the girl. They all have triangle heads. You talk to her.

  Her: "Have you found what you're looking for?"
  Her: "Purpose?"
  Chase: "I'm not sure, I don't think I've found it yet."
  Her: "Me too. What, do you think you're the only one who hasn't?"
  Chase: "Nothing I accomplish is fulfilling for me. Are you telling me
          that happens to everyone?"
  Her: "No, of course not. Some people have it easier than others, but that
        is how it is."
  Chase: "Seriously? "It is what it is?" You have to be kidding."
  Her: "You're trying too hard to find a solution, Chase.
        Have you always been like this?"
  Chase: "Pretty much most of my life."
  Her: "But not always?"
  Chase: "Ah, great. We're "focusing on the positives."
          I understand now that you don't understand.
          Goodbye."

      ..."
- C: "Are you still there..?"
- F: "I'm sorry, I just realized I didn't escape after all.
      It turns out I'm still in the prison, there was just
      a bigger one around the previous one.
